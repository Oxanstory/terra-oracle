First of all, I am glad that you came with 
your photo and did not mask the photo of the
 cat for yourself! Secondly, 13 people died 
due to design flaws, so first correct your 
past ideas and then make new or innovative 
solutions. Backing up with transaction profit. Backing up with trade profit for ust, lunc and Luna. It gives several thousand dollars from a few cents? So instead of profit stick the project and strengthen the support, because people like stability and stability, restart the Luna factory after the support, just as Luna's fear lowered it, trust and support can raise it!
